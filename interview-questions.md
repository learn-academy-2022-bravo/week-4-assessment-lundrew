# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are properties in React and can be passed from component to component in React. 

  Researched answer: Props are arguments passed into React components. The reason we use props is to pass data from one component to another (from parent component to a child component). Props is a shorter way of saying properties. Props are passed to the component in a similar way as arguments are passed in a function. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is when an action takes place on the webpage. This could be like an onClick event for example. 

  Researched answer: DOM events are signals that something has occurred or can be triggered by user interactions or by the browser. 
  Examples of DOM events include:
  - When a user clicks the mouse
  - When a web page has loaded
  - When an image has been loaded
  - When the mouse moves over an element
  - When an input field is changed
  - When an HTML form is submitted
  - When a user presses a key



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a philosophy that focuses on creating through objects within javascript. 

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming or OOP prevents data from moving freely around the system. OOP ties data securely within a function that operates on it. The reason for OOP is to protect the data from accidental modification from an outside function. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: An integer is a number and a float is a number with a decimal. 

  Researched answer: Floats and integers are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer is a number without a decimal point where a float is a floating-point number which means it has a decimal place. Floats are used when precision is needed. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: an implicit return is where we can return some code without the keyword "return". Implicit return is an implied return. 

  Researched answer: Ruby's implicit return will return the value of the last line automatically without including the "return" key word. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: In Ruby, an instance variable is a type of variable that starts with an "@" symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming to give objects their own private space to staore data. Instance variables store data and know things. 

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a stable database management system used to store data for many web, mobile, geospatial and analytics applications. 

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails or Rails is a server side web application framework. Rails provides default structures for a database, a web service and web pages. 

4. ORM: ORM or Object-Relational Mapping is a technique for converting data between type systems using object-oriented programming languages. 

5. Active Record: Active Record is an ORM and is a layer of Ruby code that runs between your database and your logic code.
